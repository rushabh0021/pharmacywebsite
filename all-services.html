                            prescription on your behalf. Simply let us know what
                            repeat medicines you need, a few days before they
                            run out, either in person, by phone, email, or via
                            this website and we will arrange to collect the
                            prescription from your Doctor’s surgery. We go daily
                            to all the Doctors’ surgeries in our area. There is
                            Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) which can save
                            your time by having your GP send your prescriptions
                            electronically (safely and securely) to our pharmacy
                            (if you nominate this pharmacy to be your
                            preference). This means you’ll no longer have to
                            collect a paper repeat prescription from your GP
                            practice – instead, you can go straight to our
                            pharmacy to pick up your prescription when they are
                            ready. We also provide local home delivery service
                            if requested.

                            established to ensure better communication of
                            changes to a patient’s medication when they leave
                            the hospital and to reduce incidences of avoidable
                            harm caused by medicines. By referring patients to
                            the community pharmacy on discharge with information
                            about medication changes made in the hospital, the
                            community pharmacy can support patients to improve
                            outcomes, prevent harm and reduce readmissions.

                            Using the right inhaler technique helps you breathe

                            needed. You’re less likely to get side effects,
                            because not much of the medicine is absorbed into
                            the rest of your body, and you’re giving yourself
                            the best chance of managing your symptoms. The
                            pharmacy team can help you with the right technique

                            Emergency contraception helps to prevent pregnancy
                            after having unprotected sex or if the contraception
                            you and your partner have used has become impaired.
                            To be effective, emergency contraception should be
                            used as soon as possible – within the 72-hour window
                            after unprotected sex.

                            Anyone can catch head lice, regardless of whether
                            your hair is long or short and clean or dirty.
                            However they’re passed by direct head-to-head
                            contact head lice can’t jump, swim or fly so
                            children are more likely to catch them and pass them
                            around when playing with friends at nursery or
                            school. Head lice are small insects, up to 3mm long
                            and can be difficult to spot. Head lice eggs (nits)
                            are yellow, brown or white (empty shells) and are
                            attached to the hair.

                            Head lice can make your head feel itchy or like
                            something is moving in your hair. The only way to be
                            sure someone has head lice is by finding live lice
                            or eggs. You can do this by combing their hair with
                            a special fine-toothed comb.

                            Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight proves to
                            be one of the most difficult challenges faced by all
                            of us today. Being overweight and the complications
                            associated with excess weight is a growing concern
                            that is becoming more prominent. Currently, in the
                            UK, 63% of adults are classed as either overweight
                            or obese.

                            It is widely understood that carrying excess body
                            fat can lead to serious health complications such as
                            diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.
                            Obesity is also one of the leading causes of
                            preventable cancers in the UK contributing to one in
                            20 of all cases.

                            can help you lose excess fat the right way. Losing

                            are both achievable and sustainable is the best way
                            towards a healthier and happier lifestyle.

                            lose weight and to keep it off long-term. But if

                            Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the
                            inability to achieve and maintain an erection that
                            is sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse.
                            ED is very common with an estimated 50% of men
                            between the ages of 40 and 70 suffering to some
                            degree. There are various causes of ED, divided into
                            psychological (i.e. stress, anxiety and depression)
                            and physical (i.e. high blood pressure, elevated
                            cholesterol and diabetes) causes. ED may be caused
                            by a serious underlying condition and even if not
                            can still be upsetting for the sufferer and put a
                            strain on relationships. It is therefore important
                            to seek medical advice and treatment options.

                      A vaccine called MenACWY provides defence against the
                      meningococcal bacteria that can cause meningitis and
                      septicaemia. You typically get the injection into your
                      upper arm. It’s crucial to know how to defend yourself
                      from disease-causing microorganisms if you intend to
                      travel outside the country, for example to Saudi Arabia
                      for Hajj and Umrah. Young teenagers, sixth formers and
                      "fresher" students going to university for the first time
                      are advised to have the vaccination.

                    <p>
                      The meningitis ACWY vaccines offers protection against 4
                      types of bacteria that can cause meningitis: meningococcal
                      groups A, C, W and Y.

                    <p>
                      Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia are especially at risk of
                      contracting meningococcal infection. There have been
                      outbreaks in recent years. A proof of immunisation is
                      needed to obtain a visa to go to Saudi Arabia for this
                      purpose.

                    Appreciated by families and carers, our Disposable dosette

                    required medications. Disposable Dosette boxes can help form
                    a crucial part of an individual’s health maintenance routine
                    and successfully prevent doses from being forgotten or taken
                    incorrectly. In particular, those who might be at risk of
                    injury due to prescription medicine mismanagement would
                    benefit from our Dosette Box Services. Dosette boxes through

                  <h4>What are the Benefits of a Disposable Dosette Box?</h4>
                  <p>
                    As you get older, you might find regular medication becoming
                    a part of your everyday routine. With a dosette box to sort
                    and store your medication, maintaining your health can
                    remain a simple task, free from hassle. Dosette boxes offer
                    a visual reminder to patients of what medicines they have
                    left to take, lessening the risk of forgetting a dose or
                    accidentally and dangerously doubling up. All compartments
                    are safely sealed and clearly labelled.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our dosette box collection service allows us to dispose of
                    any unused medication responsibly while also monitoring each
                    patient’s prescription intake. In this way, we can
                    communicate any inconsistencies directly to the GP
                    overseeing care, ensuring each patient is adhering to the
                    medicine regimes prescribed by their doctors.
                  </p>

                  <h4>Disposable Dosette Box Design</h4>
                  <p>
                    The functionality of a disposable dosette box is even
                    incorporated into the actual design with helpful elements
                    printed right on the box. These include:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="service">
                    <li>
